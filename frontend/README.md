##Task App
A responsive and interactive full-stack web application that enables users to efficiently manage their tasks, track progress, and improve productivity. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), the app offers various features including user registration, login authentication, and personalized to-do lists. Users can create, update, and delete to-do items with real-time updates that reflect changes instantly.

##How It’s Made:
MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was used to store and retrieve the todo items. On the backend, I used Express.js, framework for building RESTful APIs, to handle the HTTP requests and communicate with the database. React.js, was used for the frontend to create dynamic and reusable components to handle various aspects of the user interface. And finally, Node.js provided the runtime environment for running the server-side code.

User authentication was implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). Additionally, sensitive user data, such as passwords, were hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database to enhance security.

Tech used: MongoDB, Express, React, Node, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and Bcrypt)

##Features
Users can register and log in to access their personalized todo lists. They can create new todo items by providing a description and save them to their list. The app also allows users to update the content of existing todo items as they progress with their tasks. Additionally, users can delete any completed or no longer relevant todo items. The app provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks effectively.
